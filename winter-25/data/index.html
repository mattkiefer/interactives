        The role of data in interactive journalism
      </h2>
      <p>
        Transparency is a core tenet of modern journalism and a key factor in gaining audience trust. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As a journalist, it's not always enough to simply state your findings. To gain credibility, you have to show your work and bring receipts. You can often accomplish this by citing reliable data and explaining your analyses -- ideally in a way that allows your audience to interact with the information and do some of their own research. 
      </p>
      <p>That leads to an additional benefit of working with data in digital formats - it's engaging. Lookup tables allow users to search through piles of records for the one that's most pertinent to them. Visualizations present information on maps, timelines or categorical comparisons. Other production effects can help your audience understand the significance of numbers that may be otherwise difficulty to parse.</p>

        How to find data-driven stories
      </h2>
      <p>
        Which comes first - the story idea or the data set that tells it? It's a chicken-and-egg question and many data journalists have their own opinions about the best way to find a news story. Some comb through data portals looking for something that catches their eye. Others focus on real-world situations and imagine the digital paper trail they leave behind. One journalist may notice a bunch of parking stickers on cars along a particular block, for example, while another may notice clusters of tickets while scrolling through a spreadsheet. At the end of the day, either one could come up with the same story pitch about parking tickets in the neighbrhood. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Start with the data portals, which are repositories of frequently-sought public records that are maintained at federal and state levels, along with some counties and municipalities. They provide a window into government operations large and small - business licenses, construction projects, bikeshare rentals. Here are a few to get started:

  <h2>Exploratory analysis</h2>
  <p>
    During the research phase, you'll want to be skeptical of data sets. Just like any human source, data sets can offer a limited or skewed view of the world. Do your due diligence and run through a checklist when considering a data set to include in your reporting:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Where did the data come from? Is it a reliable source with a clear methodology?</li>
    <li>Are there any gaps or ommissions? For example, if the data is a time series, do you see all the dates and times you would expect? Or if the data is geographic, are all the expected regions included?</li>
    <li>How clean and consistent are the records? Are dates and times formatted correctly? Do numerical fields only contain numbers - or is there inline text that will break your math formulas? If some fields contain categories, are those spelled consistently? Do you have to split or combine any text fields?</li>
    <li>Who can you contact with questions? Three helpful sources would include someone who maintains the data, someone with expert knowledge in the subject and at least one person who is directly impacted.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Files and formats</h2>
  <p>Spreadsheet programs, like Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel, make it pretty simple to get started with exploring data. In order to open a spreadsheet with these programs, you'll look for certain types of files meant for displaying data in tables. These include .xlsx and .csv files, among others. We won't delve too far into importing other types of files -- for now, let's just stick with the basics.</p>
  <p>Spreadsheets are represented by horizontal rows of data that are defined by fields that are typically defined in the top "header" row. There are some exceptions but this is the ideal structure that makes it easy to analyze your spreadsheet.</p>
  <h2>Sorting and filtering</h2>
  <p>Sort a spreadsheet to see the data in a specified order. In Google Sheets, you'll want to select your entire data table and then from the Data menu => Sort range => Advanced sorting options. Check that your data has a header row, and then select the header(s) you want to sort by.</p>
  <p>Filter a data set to only display the rows you're interested in, hiding the rest out of sight. Under the Data menu => Create a filter. You can then click the filter icon next to a field header and specify the conditions for your filter</p>
  <h2>Math</h2>
  <p>Spreadsheets can do basic math using formulas. The syntax for formulas calls for an equal sign = followed by the function name. Most functions will take some parameters, like a cell or range of cells, that are specified within parenthesis after the function name. For example, a formula that sums rows 2-5 in column A would be =sum(A2:A5).</p>
  <p>Other useful functions include average, median, round and others. Check the Google Sheets <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/table/25273?hl=en">function reference</a> for info on math and other types of functions.</p>
  <p>Need to calculate change over time? That's (new-old)/old. Don't forget the parenthesis.</p>
  <h2>Type formatting</h2>
  <p>Sometimes your data isn't ready for math. That may because the numbers in your spreadsheet may be formatted as text. Or dates may not be in proper format to respond to less-than or greater-than filters.</p>
  <p>If you need to fix a format, highlight the cells in question, then use the Format menu => Number and select the custom number format tool to see your options.</p>
  <h2>Working with text</h2>
  <p>Text can be tricky. Sometimes you have too much information in one cell and need to split it up, like a mailing address that includes the street, city and ZIP code info all in one string of text. Other times, you may want to combine those separate fields into one single address.</p>
  <p>For the first problem, you'll use Data => Split text to columns and indicate which character you want to represent a column-break. And when you want to combine text, use the =CONCATENATE() function.</p>
  <h2>Aggregating data</h2>
  <p>Use pivot tables to understand broader trends with categorical data. A pivot table would allow you to group and count (or sum, or average) all your records.</p>
  <img src="pivot-table.gif" width="100%" />
  <p>Using a baseball analogy, pretend you have a stack of trading cards. Pivot tables would allow you to put those cards into different "stacks" and say things about them. Organized by position, you could find out which position has the highest fielding percentage. Or, organized by team, you could see where the Chicago Cubs stack up in a league ranking of home runs.</p>
  <h2>Visualization</h2>
  <p>While you consider story ideas and the data you need to report them out, think about the best visual approach to tell those stories. If the stories are geographic, you may want to consider a map. Change over time? Line charts work for those. Donuts and segmented bar charts are good for categorical comparison.</p>
